## UX

### Colour Scheme



- `#F5F5F5` used for primary text. (?)
- `#A8A8FF` used for primary highlights. (?) 
- `#EEBB62` used for secondary highlights. 
- `#1D0F39` used as background color. 
- `#595492` used as form background color. 


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/1d0f39-a8a8ff-f5f5f5-595492-eebb62) to generate my color palette.

## Wireframes

Explain why chose desktop wireframes only

(To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.)

I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features

Describe each feature as detailed as possible, what value for user, focus on who website is for, what do they want to achieve, how this is best way to help achieve this.
reference the specific project files that implement the features. Include screenshots!

### Future Features

- **Calendar in upcoming talks section**

    - It would be interesting to include an interactive calendar in the upcoming talks page to display all past and upcoming seminars and export calender entries to personal calendars.

- **Archive**

    - In the initial wireframes I included an Archive page and then decided in the planning stages that this was beyond the scope of this project. Therefore, it would be very desirable to implement an Archive page as a future feature. This page would contain details, such as dates, titles, speakers etc. of past seminars. Most notably it would include videos of all past talks. 

<details>
<summary> Click here to see the desktop wireframe for a possible Archive page.</summary>

</details>

- **Online participation sign-up**

    - It would add to the value of the page, if users from anywhere in the world could sign up to participate in any of the seminars remotely. This could be done through a sign-up page where users can register to participate in a zoom webinar or meeting.
